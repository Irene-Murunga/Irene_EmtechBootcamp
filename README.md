School Payment Engine (Dummy Project)

Introduction

Welcome to the School Payment Engine (SPE)! This project is a dummy application developed by a diverse group of 16 students from backgrounds including Education, Engineering, BCom, and IT. The primary goal of this project was to introduce us to coding as we transition into Software Development and enhance our coding skills in Python/Django while gaining a comprehensive understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Project Overview

The School Payment Engine encompasses several key modules designed to streamline various financial operations for schools:

- Instalment Payment Module (Lipa Mdogo Mdogo): Enables parents to pay school fees in manageable instalments. Features include custom instalment setup, auto-deductions, payment reminders, and flexibility in payments.

- Expense and Expense Types Management System: Facilitates the tracking and management of expenses across various categories. Key functionalities include expense recording, categorization, and customizable reporting.

- Suppliers Module: Manages supplier information, purchase orders, invoice handling, payment processing, and supplier performance evaluation. This module aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in procurement and financial transactions.

- Salaries, Government Allocation, and School Creation Management System: Automates payroll processing, manages government fund allocations, and supports the creation and management of schools. Includes features for salary calculations, fund tracking, and school management.

 Purpose

This project was undertaken to:
- Enhance Coding Skills: Develop our proficiency in Python and Django.
- Understand SDLC: Gain a thorough understanding of the complete software development lifecycle, from planning and design to development, testing, and deployment.
- Promote Collaboration: Work effectively within a diverse team, leveraging our varied academic backgrounds to contribute to a unified project goal.
